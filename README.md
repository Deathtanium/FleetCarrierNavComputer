I don't recommend custom HUD's with this.

1.Generate system list with spansh.co.uk/fleet-carrier

2.Put system names in itinerary.txt

3.Run script.

4.Go in-game, set interface brightness to max and sit in your carrier with a ship that has at least 250 tons of cargo space

5.Stay out of any menus, press f11 and wait. Do not tab out the game. To stop press f12

6.If you start again with the same itinerary, the script will ignore the systems you already jumped to
